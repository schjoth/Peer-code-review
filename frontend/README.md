# Peer Code Review - Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Installation

In order to make the application work, you need to have created a [GitHub app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/overview) and [Auth0 app](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications).

The GitHub app needs to have the following permissions:

- Issues: Read & write
- Pull requests: Read & write
- Discussions: Read & write
- Contents: Read

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
